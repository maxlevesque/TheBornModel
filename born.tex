We want to compute the free energy of solvation of an ion of charge $Ze$, with $e$ the elementary charge of an electron, in a
continum dielectric medium of dielectric constant $\epsilon_0 \epsilon$, with $\epsilon_0$ the dielectric constant of vacuum.
The free energy of solvation is the free energy necessary to bring an ion from vacuum to inside the medium.
One can decompose it into three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Discharge the ion in the vacuum, $\Delta G_{\text{discharge}}$
\item Immerge the discharged ion in the continum dielectric medium, $\Delta G_{\text{immersion}}$
\item Charge the ion in the continum dielectric medium, $\Delta G_{\text{charge}}$.
\end{enumerate}
We have
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G_{\text{solvation}} = \Delta G_{\text{discharge}} + \Delta G_{\text{immersion}} + \Delta G_{\text{charge}}.
\end{equation}

In the Born model, the dielectric medium only have electrostatic interactions. The free energy of immersion is thus zero.
This may seem a crude approximation, because chemical interactions, e.g., are neglected.

\subsection{Free energy of discharging in vacuum and charging in the dielectric medium}

In the Born model, an ion of charge $q$ is spherical of radius $a$. The electrostatic potential $\phi(r)$ created by the charge
of the ion in vacuum is
\begin{equation}
    \phi(r)=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r}.
\end{equation}
The work to bring a charge $dq$ at the surface of the sphere is $d\Delta G_{\text{discharge}} = -\phi(a)dq$. 
It is negative because one brings an opposite charge to discharge.
After integration over the charge:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta G_{\text{discharge}} &=& \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0 a} \int_0^{-q} q dq \\
    &=& -\frac{q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 a}.
\end{eqnarray}

The same reasoning leads to $\Delta G_{\text{charge}} = \frac{q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 \epsilon a}$. Note it is positive.

Finally,
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta G_{\text{solvation}} &=& \Delta G_{\text{discharge}} + \Delta G_{\text{charge}} \\
    &=& \frac{q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 a} \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon} - 1 \right).
\end{eqnarray}

The bigger $\epsilon$, the smaller $\Delta G_{\text{solvation}}$

% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column
% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}

% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape
% figure
% \begin{turnpage}
% \begin{figure}

% tables should appear as floats within the text
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
% reasonable default table settings.
% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
% in longtable).
% \begin{table}%[H] add [H] placement to break table across pages
% \caption{\label{}}
% \begin{ruledtabular}
% \begin{tabular}{}
% Lines of table here ending with \\
